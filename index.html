		Inital recourse hunting<br><br>
		To create my project I will need to learn how to embed a map into a website and have it be intractable, and also a submission page for people to
		upload images/sightings of QR codes around Wellington.<br><br>

		I started to research how to get the map working because I think it might be the harder part of making a working prototype.
		I found out that Google has a 'My Maps' feature where you can make and customise your own map and embed it in a website.
		I also found <a href="https://snazzymaps.com/" tagrget="new">https://snazzymaps.com/,</a>  which is a creative commons data base of different map styles that can be used on My Maps.
		This will likely be helpful in making my map coherent with my brand. <br><br>There are other sites I could look at using
		like <a href=" https://www.mapbox.com/">https://www.mapbox.com/ </a>but these look to be aimed more towards businesses and people who have a better understanding of code than me.
<br><br>
		I also researched how to make a form submission page in code. I found a couple of articles with helpful information on this.<br>

		Brainstorming<br><br>
		I was looking at several different ways to bring the Q-ARCHIVE to life.<br><br>

My first idea was a <b>website.</b> This would be practical because when most people are browsing the internet or looking at things like archives they are on a desktop device.
It is also easy to make it interactive with a embedded map and submission form.
This is the idea I am leaning towards most. <br>The only flaw I can think of is that most people scan QR codes with their phone, so a desktop is not necessarily ideal for that.
However, users can have the QR code on their desktop and scan it on their phone if they want, so it is not too big of a flaw. Alternatively
the QR code will be accompanied with a hyper linked URL on the website archive so they can just click that on their desktop device. <br><br>

My second idea was a <b>physical printed out map,</b> say maybe a1 or a0 size and stuck on a wall in a public (but indoor) space. This would make it an interactive <b>exhibition</b>, therefore limiting its audience to curious people who go into exhibit spaces, or those who have heard of it. It would be on the wall, and people would be able to pick up physical location pins (individually numbered) then place them on the map where they saw a QR code. There will be an accompanying table with the pin numbers, and a space next to it for the person to write the url that the QR code led them to.<br> A flaw of this is that it would limit the number of entries, as there is a physical space limit on the physical map, and it would be less permanent than a digital archive.

<br><br>
My last idea for this project is a mobile <b>app</b> that has the map functionality. The only way this would really be different to the website is layout,
and maybe a few added features like saving favourite codes. This seems unnecessary though and will lose the desktop audience. The main pro to
this idea is that people use their phones to scan QR codes so it would be convenient, and the websites that the codes lead to are likely
optimised for phones. <br><br>

I think I will work on a website prototype, as it seems like the most effective way to create Q-ARCHIVE.

			<h2 id="3">Coding</h2>
			<p> When walking around the city, I see many QR codes on posters and stickers that lead to a vast variety of web pages, but I know that none of these are permanent. <br><br>I began thinking of a way to preserve these codes in a
				way that is still explorable and accessible by the public.<br><br>Here is a selection of the codes I encountered on my way to and from university.</p>
