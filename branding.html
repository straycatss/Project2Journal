		<h2>Main Logo</h2>
	<p> The name Q-Archive is a play on the term QR code and archive. <thead>

	</thead><br><br>The Q-Archive logo takes on a glitch style aesthic. This try of art is influenced by computer programming and and technology and gives the brand a futuristic vibe. <br><br>Glitches are imperfections with technology,
		 much the same way that many of the QR code stickers around the city are grafitti, which will eventually be removed. </p>

<h2> Image Only Logo </h2>
<p>The image only version of the Q-ARCHIVE logo should be used in paces where there is not enough space for the word logo, or the brand name has already been established elsewhere.
	<br><br> It uses the same colour scheme and has a transparent background. It should
	only be used on dark backgrounds, as it will not show up well on lighter ones.
	<br><br>The logo itself is a combination of a computer file symbol like <a href="https://www.shutterstock.com/image-vector/file-folder-icons-set-all-document-1232913895" target="_blank">these,</a> and the squares that are found in
	three of the corners of a QR code. These sqaures are known as timing patterns and help orient the scanner and are especially useful if the code is distorted or damaged. More can be read about the structure of QR codes

<h2>Colour Pallet</h2>
<p> The colour pallet for the website is inspired by glitch/Neo-Tokyo colours. These bright neon colours will be used against a dark, blue tinted background colour scheme.

		<h2> Primary font <br>- Source Code Pro </h2>
		<p> Source Code Pro is a Google font which can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro"> here.</a>
			<br><br>It was origianlly designed to use in code programs, because all of the glyphs have uniform widths. However, on the Q-ARCHIVE website it will help give a digital and futuristic feel to the website. It will be used for all of the headers on the website.

		<h2> Secondary font <br>- Lato </h2>
		<p> Lato is a Google font which can be found <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?selection.family=Lato#standard-styles"> here.</a>
			<br><br>Compared to Source Code Pro, it is lighter and easier to read as a body font on a website, while still keeping the same visual style of the primary font. Both of the fonts I have chosen are sans serif fonts as to increase legibility online.
