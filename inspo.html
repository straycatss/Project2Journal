		<h2>Inspiration</h2>

		<p> WTF QR CODES<br><br>Inspiration for this project includes other digital QR code archives, like <a href="https://wtfqrcodes.tumblr.com/" target="_blank"> WTF QR Codes </a> on Tumblr.
			<br><br>This blog was dedicated to 'stupid' QR codes but still served to keep a log of QR codes that people can scan and go to the cooresponding web page.
			<br><br>This was also a good example of what I want to achieve in the way that it is community based. People could send in photos from wherever they were in the world to be shared on this site.	</p>

			<p>Dead Drops<br><br>Another inspiration for my project is the database for the locations of <a href=https://deaddrops.com/db-map-2/>Dead Drops</a> around the globe. This site features a submission function, as well as a map that
				users can find their way around.
				<br><br>Because Dead Drops is an offline project, you cannot find any data apart from the location of the USB stick, and photos of its placement on the database.
				<br><br>On Q-ARCHIVE, I want there to be a hyperlink to where the original QR code was found, as well as a
				clear photo of the original QR code. This way people using the archive can travel on a digital journey through all of the websites that the QR codes lead to. </p>
